## Description
I built this project to test my knowledge of react. I did my best to port my old portfolio over to react. While using react was a bit over kill for such a simple page, doing so really honed my skills with the react library. 

I learned a lot about react, how it works with bootstrap, and all the little things that change. It also gave me a chance to go over my old portfolio with a fine comb and iron out some things that I wasn't happy with. I used react-router, even though it is a one page app. This also was a good first practice just getting all the syntax right.
